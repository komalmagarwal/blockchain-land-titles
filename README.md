# Blockchain Land Titles

This project demonstrates a prototype blockchain-based system for registering and verifying land title ownership.

## Why It Matters
In many rural and emerging markets, land ownership records are paper-based or incomplete, preventing farmers from accessing financing or selling at fair value.  
A blockchain registry provides secure, tamper-proof, and easily verifiable records.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Web3.py
- Ethereum Testnet (Ganache / Infura)
- IPFS (for document storage)

## Key Features
- Register land titles with unique property IDs
- Verify ownership and transaction history on blockchain
- Store supporting documents in a distributed file system (IPFS)
